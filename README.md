# Structure_Generation


`lib`   - folder containing modules : functions and classes for structure generation & optimization routines
`genalg_GSQS` -  folder containing an important example (reproducing traditional SQS for alloys)
`genalg_GSQS_dynamic` - folder featuring the unique capability of ACE-based GSQS (ability to move move atoms off-lattice to find candidate structures for matching some target)
`monte_GSQS` - similar to other GSQS example folders, but contains a simulated annealing algorithm instead of a
genetic algorithm to optimize loss functions

`other_enumeration` - other methods for structure generation & enumeration (only included for reference and comparison)
will be removed in later versions

## NOTE

For theoretical definitions and methods, see the manuscript at: (overleaf for now)
