# Structure_Generation

## Requirements
FitSNAP - (post library update) 
ASE - v 3.22.1
lammps - LAMMPS (post mliap update)

You must add the fitsnap folder to your PYTHONPATH in order to use
the ACE descriptor setup functionalities. Otherwise, you must bring your own
ACE descriptor file (.yace).

Add the `/path/to/Structure_Generation/lib` folder to your PYTHONPATH

`export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/Structure_Generation/lib`

*NOTE fitsnap must also be in your pythonpath*

## Parent folder contents

`lib`   - folder containing helper functions and classes for structure generation & optimization routines
`tools` - some extra helper scripts here - may be removed.

`examples` folder containing examples for local (lammps) and global optimization (genetic algorithm, simulated annealing) - See further details in the README of the examples folder
